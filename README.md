# datalake_housing_project

As a data engineer, the main focus is to reduce costs by avoiding vendor lock-in and minimizing the complexity of tools and technologies. Instead, the goal is to ensure that data remains secure, easily accessible, and free from excessive charges. This is where data lake warehousing provides an effective solution, offering scalable, secure, and cost-efficient storage and processing options.

This project demonstrates how to build a cost-effective and efficient lakehouse using open-source technology.
